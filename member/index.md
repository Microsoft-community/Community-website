# Member Information
We'd like you to bear in mind that none of our **moderators** work for nor are affiliated with Microsoft. **Verified employees will rock the `Microsoft employees` role.**
## Rules
#### 1. No harassment, hate speech, racism, sexism, trolling, stereotype based attacks, de-bloaters/privacy scripts, or spreading harmful/false information. You may be banned immediately and without warning or recourse.
#### 2. Do not post anything that is NSFW. If you are unsure if it's considered NSFW you shouldn't post it. 
#### 3. Do not ask for money or any other goods (such as games or Nitro), or offer money in exchange for receiving support. Furthermore, don't advertise/sell your bots, servers, services, products or anything else. If you're not sure if something is an advertisement, contact Moderators' Mail.
#### 4. Do not stir up drama. If there is a conflict, work to defuse it instead of making it worse. 
#### 5. Do not mention or DM inactive members who aren't part of the present conversation. Don't bother Microsoft employees *(or anyone else)* with tech support/moderation related queries. This rule doesn't apply if you're mentioning someone with whom you have some kind of mutual relationship.
#### 6. Refrain from using too many special characters in your nickname. A symbol or two is fine but have a normal alphanumeric name that is easily typed. Also, do not impersonate any public figures. Having the same name and profile picture as a product/service is allowed but do not role-play as them.
#### 7. Use the correct channels for your messages. If there is a better channel for the current conversation then use it, and don't post the same thing in multiple places. Furthermore, political content of any kind (including memes) belongs exclusively in #politics, unlocked at Tier 2.
#### 8. Users in direct violation of Discord's Terms of Service will be banned without warning. This includes the use of userbots or not meeting the minimum age requirement.
#### 9. Check the description in each channel before posting as extended rules may exist for that channel.
#### 10. If a staff member tells you to stop doing something then you should stop doing that thing.
#### 11. No content related to piracy or illegal activities.
#### 12. No discussing moderation actions outside of modmail.
#### 13. Do not attempt to take support or other requests outside of the server as we cannot ensure your or the user's safety from scams, trolling and abuse. This includes suggesting the use of DMs or remote assistance tools (such as Quick Assist or TeamViewer).
#### 14. No problematic content or media. This includes anything that could induce epilepsy (without obstructing the content with a spoiler and making a disclaimer), anything that can crash, restart or exploit the Discord client, or trigger a user's antivirus (even if it is not inherently dangerous).
#### 15. No typing in any other language than English; we cannot moderate different languages and most people here speak in English. Failure to oblige will result in a warning or mute.
#### 16. Non contributive, incoherent behavior which is disruptive to the community and conversations will not be tolerated.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Is this server official?
No, this server is not official. It is community-run, it is not run by Microsoft. Also none of our moderators are (to the best of our knowledge) affiliated with Microsoft in any way. We do have official Microsoft employees in the server, however, but they have joined of their own free will, and not as part of their job.
### How do I report something?
Send a private message to **@Moderators' mail**, found at the top of the members list. The message should include as much information as you can reasonably provide.
If, in the event of any technical issues, the moderators mail bot is not found at the top of the members list, it will be replaced by the moderators, who in this instance only, you may directly message regarding your issue.
### I got muted! What should I do?
Think about what you’ve done and wait patiently for the mute to expire. If you believe that the mute was unwarranted, message modmail as above and explain clearly and calmly why you believe you shouldn't have been muted.
### Nobody is answering my question or helping me! What should I do?
Firstly, be patient. It might take a while for someone to be able to help you. Furthermore, consider if when you asked you’ve provided as much detail as possible to make it easy for us to help you. If you’ve done this, and you still need help and it’s been around a day or so and you’ve not had any help, then consider asking again.
### Why does the server icon keep changing?
The server icon is changed to celebrate certain events, usually major holidays or important dates in computing history.
### When is [MS update/product] going to be released?
When Microsoft decide to release it. Use search, since it’s likely this question will have been asked many, many times before.
### Are those real Microsoft employees?
Yes, they are. They’re verified through their employee account. However, they aren’t here on official business and anything they say does not in any way represent Microsoft. They’re just here like any other user. Don’t ping them for support unless they’re actively helping you; it will be considered a violation of rule 5.
### Why can’t I post images or videos?
As a spam prevention measure, you need the `@Tier 1 (Regular)` role to be able to upload images. This role can be gained by being active for a little while. In the meantime, you can upload images to an alternative service like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/).
### I got warned! How many times can I get warned before I get banned?
There is no set number; that is up to the discretion of the Moderators. We suggest that you read the rules and follow them as to avoid any conflicts.
### I applied to become a moderator, how long before I get an answer? 
We will get back to you only if we need to talk to you regarding your application. You may or may not hear anything back (patience is a good quality we look at ;) ). Consider it analogous to a job application, your info is pooled with other people who are also interested in the position and it is up to us to determine who the best fit for the position is, and when to bring them on board. 

## Ban Appeal Process
You can send ban appeals <a href="https://appeal.msft.chat/" title="link to appeal form">here</a> if you meet our requirements, appeal will be looked into by our moderators team.

### Requirements
