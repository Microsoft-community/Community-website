# Member Information
Microsoft Community is just that- a community server. None of the moderators work for Microsoft nor are affiliated with it in any way (as far as we know).
## Rules
#### 1. No harassment, hate speech, racism, sexism, trolling, stereotype based attacks, or giving harmful support advice. You may be banned immediately and without warning or recourse.
#### 2. Do not post anything that is NSFW. If you are unsure if it is considered NSFW you shouldn't post it. 
#### 3. Do not ask for money, offer to exchange services for money or in-game currency, or advertise your bot or servers.
#### 4. Do not stir up drama. If there is a conflict, work to defuse it instead of making it worse. 
#### 5. Do not spam anyone with mentions or DM inactive members who aren't part of the present conversation. Don't bother Microsoft employees with tech support/moderation related queries.
#### 6. Refrain from using special characters in your username/nickname. 
#### 7. Please be mindful of channels and their uses, failure to do so may result in loss of access to the channel.
#### 8. Unapproved user bots will be banned without warning.
#### 9. Check the description in each channel before posting as extended rules may exist for that channel.
#### 10. If a staff member tells you to stop doing something then you should stop doing that thing.
#### 11. No content related to piracy or illegal activities.
#### 12. No discussing moderation actions outside of modmail and #server-feedback.
#### 13. Don't ask to be directly messaged for help or any other kind of service; we cannot prevent scams/trolling when it goes outside of server channels.
#### 14. No content which may induce epilepsy without first making a disclaimer and obstructing the content.
#### 15. No typing in any other language than English; we cannot moderate different languages and most people here speak in English. Failure to oblige will result in a warning or mute.

## Channels
| Channel                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| #rules-and-info           | The server rules.                                                                                                                                                       |
| #announcements            | Notifications about the server will be posted here by staff. Microsoft employees and staff may also post tech news and upcoming events that may be of interest to you.                                                                                                |
| #general-chat             | A place to talk about anything that doesn’t fall under one specific channel, is generally related to technology, and to chat with friends. Try to keep to the current topic of conversation, and if something is more suited for another channel, then post it there. |
| #mobile                   | Talk about all your mobile devices here, be it phones, tablets or smart watches. Any operating system and manufacturer are welcomed here.                                                                                                                             |
| #random-stuff             | Memes, random non-tech stuff, and slightly less structured conversations can go here. Other things that go here are bot commands, less-serious technical support, and any overflow from #general-chat.                                                                |
| #tech-support        | Have you got a problem that you’re unable to fix, or just a query that you can’t find the answer for? Ask here! Any support offered here is not official Microsoft support, is offered upon other members' discretion, and may not be accurate or work.        |
| #insiders                 | Discussion of all Insider programs (yes, there’s a few). You’ll also get updates to Windows Insider builds here, as well as opportunities to give feedback to actual Microsoft employees about the future of Windows and other Microsoft products.                    |
| #anime                 | Feel free to utilise this channel for discussions about anime, manga and other related Japanese media. Animemes are tolerated, but NSFW content is disallowed under all circumstances.                    |
| #retrospective-and-betas  | Have you got an old DOS PC, a Palm Pilot, or just really love Windows XP? Feel free to discuss it here. There’s plenty of like-minded thinkers here who love the history of computing.                                                                                |
| #movies-books-and-tv             | A place for conversation about movies, books, and TV shows. Try to not spoil anything, and make sure to use spoiler tags.                                                                                                                                           |
| #deals-and-giveaways      | You can use this channel to organise and take part in giveaways. Do not give away any illegal goods (pirated/grey market software licenses etc.) or anything fake with the intention to disappoint.                                                                   |
| #politics                 | You gain access to this channel after being around for a while. Try to keep things civil and remember that people have different opinions. This channel is a privilege and you will lose access to it if you behave inappropriately.                                  |
| #music                    | Talk about your favourite music and artists here. You can feel free to share Spotify/YouTube links etc. Occasionally, we may host music listening parties that you can join in with and suggest songs for.                                                            |
| #development              | All your programming queries can be asked here. If you’re sharing code snippets, then using code blocks (```code goes here```) really helps keep things tidy. Like #technical-support, this is community help only.                                                   |
| #design                   | Have you made a pretty thing, are interested in discussing the future of Fluent Design or just want to show off your desktop? That’s what this channel is for.                                                                                                        |
| #servers                  | If you need help setting up, configuring or troubleshooting server hardware or software, then you can ask here for assistance. This isn’t a place to post Discord server invites, so please don’t do that.                                                            |
| #gaming                   | News and info about games can go here, as well as screenshots, clips and asking if anyone wants to play anything.                                                                                                                                                     |
| #it-pros                  | This isn’t tech support, this is where you discuss Azure, PowerShell, Office 365, SharePoint, Teams, Windows Server, Active Directory, OneDrive, Patching, Security, Automation, Compliance, Hyper-V... All the fun stuff!                                            |
| #cloud-services           | If you want to discuss cloud services and find things that are right for you, then ask here.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| #surface                  | Talk about all of Microsoft’s Surface line of hardware. If you’re considering buying a new device, and a Surface is on your radar, then ask here to get opinions from actual Surface owners.                                                                          |
| #office                   | If you need help with Office-related queries, including Word, Excel and PowerPoint assistance, then ask here for more dedicated help. You can also use this channel to just talk about Office and its features.                                                       |
| #ms-employee-verification | If you’re a Microsoft employee, you can use this channel to verify yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| #server-feedback          | If you want to discuss the server and what you think about it, then do so here. If you believe there’s any improvements that can be made, or you don’t like a recent change, here is the place to bring it up.                                                        |
| #starboard                | If a message gets five "Microheart" emoji reactions, then it should appear here! |
| #photography              | Things and thangs that you captured. This channel is not for posting memes, for memes use #random-stuff |
| Other Channels            | Sometimes, other channels may temporarily appear for competitions and applications. These will have their own rules; please abide by them. There are also other moderator-only or role-specific channels that aren’t listed here to prevent confusion.                 |

## Frequently Asked Questions
### How do I report something?
Send a private message to **@Moderators mail**, found at the top of the members list. The message should include as much information as you can reasonably provide.

If, in the event of any technical issues, the moderators mail bot is not found at the top of the members list, it will be replaced by the moderators, who in this instance only, you may directly message regarding your issue.
### I got muted! What should I do?
Think about what you’ve done and wait patiently for the mute to expire. If you believe that the mute was unwarranted, message modmail as above and explain clearly and calmly why you believe you shouldn't have been muted.
### Nobody is answering my question or helping me! What should I do?
Firstly, be patient. It might take a while for someone to be able to help you. Furthermore, consider if when you asked you’ve provided as much detail as possible to make it easy for us to help you. If you’ve done this, and you still need help and it’s been around a day or so and you’ve not had any help, then consider asking again.
### Why does the server icon keep changing?
The server icon is changed to celebrate certain events, usually major holidays or important dates in computing history.
### When is [MS update/product] going to be released?
When Microsoft decide to release it. Use search, since it’s likely this question will have been asked many, many times before.
### Are those real Microsoft employees?
Yes, they are. They’re verified through their employee account. However, they aren’t here on official business and anything they say does not in any way represent Microsoft. They’re just here like any other user. Don’t ping them for support unless they’re actively helping you; it will be considered a violation of rule 5.
