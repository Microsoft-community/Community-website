# Member Information
We'd like you to bear in mind that none of our **moderators** work for nor are affiliated with Microsoft. **Verified employees will rock the Microsoft employee role.**
## Rules
#### 1. No harassment, hate speech, racism, sexism, trolling, stereotype based attacks, or spreading harmful/false information. You may be banned immediately and without warning or recourse.
#### 2. Do not post anything that is NSFW. If you are unsure if it's considered NSFW you shouldn't post it. 
#### 3. Do not ask for money or any other goods (such as games or Nitro). Likewise, do not advertise/sell your services, products, bots or servers.
#### 4. Do not stir up drama. If there is a conflict, work to defuse it instead of making it worse. 
#### 5. Do not mention or DM inactive members who aren't part of the present conversation. Don't bother Microsoft employees *(or anyone else)* with tech support/moderation related queries. This rule doesn't apply if you're mentioning someone with whom you have some kind of mutual relationship.
#### 6. Refrain from using too many special characters in your current display name. A couple of special symbols are fine so long as there is a normal alphanumeric name that people can easily type. For example, "ExampleName 🧅" is fine, but "👊♙ εχ𝕒м𝐩𝕃𝒆ｎ𝐀𝓶𝔢 💢😾" is not.
#### 7. Please be mindful of channels and their uses, failure to do so may result in loss of access to the channel. Bringing something up once is alright, however starting a long discussion about something that belongs in another channel, or posting the same thing across multiple channels, is not.
#### 8. Users in direct violation of Discord's Terms of Service will be banned without warning. This includes the use of userbots or not meeting the minimum age requirement.
#### 9. Check the description in each channel before posting as extended rules may exist for that channel.
#### 10. If a staff member tells you to stop doing something then you should stop doing that thing.
#### 11. No content related to piracy or illegal activities.
#### 12. No discussing moderation actions outside of modmail.
#### 13. Do not attempt to take support or other requests outside of the server as we cannot ensure your or the user's safety from scams, trolling and abuse. This includes suggesting the use of DMs or remote assistance tools (such as Quick Assist or TeamViewer).
#### 14. No content which may induce epilepsy without first making a disclaimer and obstructing the content.
#### 15. No typing in any other language than English; we cannot moderate different languages and most people here speak in English. Failure to oblige will result in a warning or mute.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### How do I report something?
Send a private message to **@Moderators' mail**, found at the top of the members list. The message should include as much information as you can reasonably provide.

If, in the event of any technical issues, the moderators mail bot is not found at the top of the members list, it will be replaced by the moderators, who in this instance only, you may directly message regarding your issue.
### I got muted! What should I do?
Think about what you’ve done and wait patiently for the mute to expire. If you believe that the mute was unwarranted, message modmail as above and explain clearly and calmly why you believe you shouldn't have been muted.
### Nobody is answering my question or helping me! What should I do?
Firstly, be patient. It might take a while for someone to be able to help you. Furthermore, consider if when you asked you’ve provided as much detail as possible to make it easy for us to help you. If you’ve done this, and you still need help and it’s been around a day or so and you’ve not had any help, then consider asking again.
### Why does the server icon keep changing?
The server icon is changed to celebrate certain events, usually major holidays or important dates in computing history.
### When is [MS update/product] going to be released?
When Microsoft decide to release it. Use search, since it’s likely this question will have been asked many, many times before.
### Are those real Microsoft employees?
Yes, they are. They’re verified through their employee account. However, they aren’t here on official business and anything they say does not in any way represent Microsoft. They’re just here like any other user. Don’t ping them for support unless they’re actively helping you; it will be considered a violation of rule 5.
