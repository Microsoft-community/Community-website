# Bots

### Cliptok
Cliptok is our moderation bot, developed in-house by the wonderful [Erisa](https://erisa.uk/). It provides all the necessary moderation functions (warnings, mutes, kicks, bans etc.) as well as monitoring the chat for excessive emoji, advertising and naughty words. Cliptok is vital to our team and keeps getting better by the day. Also, do take note of the fact it uses Windows icons in its messages! How cute is that!?

Cliptok is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Erisa/cliptok). 

### GIFtok
GIFtok is Cliptok's media-obsessed sibling, who watches over all the videos and GIFs in the server. In the event any look malicious, GIFtok flags them up to let us know, so we can take action. It's unlikely you'll see any messages from GIFtok, but just know they're looking out for you!

GIFtok is based on [Sir-Fancy's CrashNt](https://github.com/Sir-Fancy/CrashNt), maintained by [Erisa](https://erisa.uk/) and available on our community repo [here](https://github.com/Microsoft-community/GIFtok). 

### Moderators' Mail

Moderators' Mail, or Modmail for short, is a quick and easy way to start a private conversation with the moderators. When you send it a message, it'll start a new thread that the moderation team can view, respond via and hold internal discussions in. The mods might also use the bot to reach out to you, so make sure you have DMs enabled!

The bot is based on [Kyb3er's modmail](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail), and our fork can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft-community/modmail).

### Corpinator

Corpinator is developed by [Cisien](https://github.com/cisien) and helps us verify real Microsoft employees utilising Azure AD. Legitimate employees are given a shiny role to help others identify them, as well as access to a private channel.

You can find Corpinator [here](https://github.com/Cisien/corpinator).

### Dotsimus

Dotsimus, developed by [Jaska](https://discordhub.com/profile/71270107371802624), is a moderation bot using the magic of machine learning to help detect toxicity and flag potentially offensive messages and users for the mods to review manually.

You can find Dotsimus' website [here](https://dotsimus.com/). Additionally, you can find the server containing more details as well as a place to play with it [here](https://discord.gg/VqKQf4M).
