# Member Information

We'd like you to bear in mind that none of our **moderators** work for nor are affiliated with Microsoft. **Verified employees will rock the `Microsoft employees` role.**

## Rules

#### 1. No harassment, hate speech, racism, sexism, trolling, stereotype-based attacks, bypassing our content filters, de-bloaters/privacy scripts, or spreading harmful/false information. You may be banned immediately and without warning or recourse.<br><br> {#rule-1}

#### 2. Do not post anything that could be considered sexual, violent (known as NSFW/NSFL) or political in nature (including memes). If you are unsure if something is considered NSFW or political, you shouldn't post it.<br><br> {#rule-2}

#### 3. Do not ask for money or any other goods (such as games or Nitro), or offer money in exchange for receiving support. Furthermore, don't advertise/sell your bots, servers, services, products or anything else. If you're not sure if something is an advertisement, contact ModMail.<br><br> {#rule-3}

#### 4. Do not stir up drama, laugh at others' misfortune or make unnecessary comments or reactions if you or others are punished. If there is a conflict, work to defuse it instead of making it worse.<br><br> {#rule-4}

#### 5. Do not mention or DM Moderators, Microsoft Employees, or any other members who aren't part of the current conversation for any matter, unless you share a mutual relationship. DM Modmail for all moderation-related queries and only ping @Moderator for emergencies like a raid or significant spam.<br><br> {#rule-5}

#### 6. Keep non-alphanumeric characters in your nickname to a minimum so that your name can be easily typed by others using standard English characters.<br><br> {#rule-6}

#### 7. Use the correct channels or threads for your messages. If there's a better place for the current conversation then use it, and don't post or link to the same thing in multiple places. Also check the description in each channel before posting, as extended rules may exist for that channel.<br><br> {#rule-7}

#### 8. Users in direct violation of Discord's Terms of Service may be banned without warning. This includes the use of userbots or not meeting the minimum age requirement.<br><br> {#rule-8}

#### 9. Do not impersonate or roleplay as any products, services, public figures, popular companies, or fictional characters in your username, avatar, or your messages.<br><br> {#rule-9}

#### 10. Respect and listen to our Moderators' decisions, requests, and wishes; do not waste their time. This includes allowing Moderators to do their job rather than taking the role upon yourself, threatening others with punishments, or telling members they broke a rule. Instead, report it in Modmail.<br><br> {#rule-10}

#### 11. No content related to piracy or illegal activities, including black and grey market sites of any kind. This includes linking to unofficial (e.g. untrusted archive sites), paywalled downloads of products (e.g. MSDN) or discussions about legal copies of Windows LTSC outside of #sysadmin.<br><br> {#rule-11}

#### 12. Do not discuss punishments given to others or yourself outside of Modmail. All Modmail communication and audit log details are private and should not be shared or discussed in the server. If you have questions or concerns, contact Modmail.<br><br> {#rule-12}

#### 13. Do not attempt to take support or other requests outside of the server as we cannot ensure your or the user's safety from scams, trolling and abuse. This includes suggesting the use of DMs or remote assistance tools (such as Quick Assist or TeamViewer).<br><br> {#rule-13}

#### 14. No problematic content or media. This includes anything that could induce epilepsy (without obstructing the content with a spoiler and making a disclaimer), anything that can crash, restart or exploit the Discord client, or trigger a user's antivirus (even if it is not inherently dangerous).<br><br> {#rule-14}

#### 15. No typing in any other language than English; we cannot moderate different languages.<br><br> {#rule-15}

#### 16. Non-contributive or incoherent behavior which is disruptive to the community and conversations will not be tolerated. This includes bumping/unarchiving threads without contributing anything relevant to them. {#rule-16}

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this server official?

No, this server is not official. It is community-run, it is not run by Microsoft. Also none of our moderators are (to the best of our knowledge) affiliated with Microsoft in any way. We do have official Microsoft employees in the server, however, but they have joined of their own free will, and not as part of their job.

### How do I report something?

Send a private message to **@Moderators' mail**, found at the top of the members list. The message should include as much information as you can reasonably provide.
If, in the event of any technical issues, the moderators mail bot is not found at the top of the members list, it will be replaced by the moderators, who in this instance only, you may directly message regarding your issue.

### I got muted! What should I do?

Think about what you’ve done and wait patiently for the mute to expire. If you believe that the mute was unwarranted, message modmail as above and explain clearly and calmly why you believe you shouldn't have been muted.

### Nobody is answering my question or helping me! What should I do?

Firstly, be patient. It might take a while for someone to be able to help you. Furthermore, consider if when you asked you’ve provided as much detail as possible to make it easy for us to help you. If you’ve done this, and you still need help and it’s been around a day or so and you’ve not had any help, then consider asking again.

### Why does the server icon keep changing?

The server icon is changed to celebrate certain events, usually major holidays or important dates in computing history.

### When is [MS update/product] going to be released?

When Microsoft decide to release it. Use search, since it’s likely this question will have been asked many, many times before.

### Are those real Microsoft employees?

Yes, they are. They’re verified through their employee account. However, they aren’t here on official business and anything they say does not in any way represent Microsoft. They’re just here like any other user. Don’t ping them for support unless they’re actively helping you; it will be considered a violation of rule 5.

### Why can’t I post images or videos?

As a spam prevention measure, you need the `@Tier 1 (Regular)` role to be able to upload images. This role can be gained by being active for a little while. In the meantime, you can upload images to an alternative service like [Imgur](https://imgur.com/).

### I got warned! How many times can I get warned before I get banned?

There is no set number; that is up to the discretion of the Moderators. We suggest that you read the rules and follow them as to avoid any conflicts.

### I applied to become a moderator, how long before I get an answer?

We will get back to you only if we need to talk to you regarding your application. You may or may not hear anything back (patience is a good quality we look at ;) ). Consider it analogous to a job application, your info is pooled with other people who are also interested in the position and it is up to us to determine who the best fit for the position is, and when to bring them on board.

## Ban Appeal Process

You can send ban appeals [here](https://appeal.msft.chat/) if you meet the following requirements:

* At least 120 days have passed since you were banned.
* You understand and are able to explain why you were banned.

### Scribblemoji

A long time ago, an inside joke resulted in the addition of a badly-drawn SharePoint emoji. This expanded until we had the whole Office suite, and then a wide range of popular logos and icons. Now, they have their own dedicated server!

Some platforms support the ability to display <kbd>K</kbd><kbd>E</kbd><kbd>Y</kbd><kbd>B</kbd><kbd>O</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>R</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> keys. Discord doesn't, so here's loads of them as emoji!
